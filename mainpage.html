this is the main page for programing languages,Programming is the process by which a programmer writes code, which is represented by a set of commands, which in turn are executed on computers. It is a special language that is used by programmers to write programs, scripts, or another set of commands to execute on a compute
The human world communicates with each other through different languages, so scientists invented a new unique way in the world of information technology to communicate with computers and other digital devices, which are orders and instructions for various digital devices so that we can communicate what we want from and to the device and how to amend it or Even deal with it. The programming languages ​​that programmers need to deal with data in digital devices are different, and these languages ​​are distinguished from each other in the form of writing commands for the computer. Each language has a unique language that is unique to the rest of the languages ​​according to the required task and the device in question. , The computer converts the language written with symbols and some acronyms in the English language into a series of numbers (0 and 1), so that data and information are stored in computers especially and digital devices in general in the form of large numbers consisting of the numbers (0 and 1), and they have names etc. A key to the ease of circulation between programmers and to understand the principle of the work of the computer and how to store data and reserve a place in the memory (hard disk). The handling of data in the past was very simple, based on the principle of algorithms, as for every entry on which mathematical operations are performed we finally get the required result and on this basis were designed, invented and developed programming languages ​​in dealing with data and methods for dealing with problems, and programming languages ​​graduated between languages Low level and high level which are: (C, Java, Delphi, non-serial object languages) and procedural (Basic, Fortron)
